## My Workflow

Need to access git commit information in your workflow like this

```yaml
- name: Get author and committer info from HEAD commit
  uses: rlespinasse/git-commit-data-action@v1.x

- name: Commit changed files
  uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4.1.6
  with:
    commit_message: "Automated commit message"
    commit_user_name: "${{ env.GIT_COMMIT_COMMITTER_NAME }}"
    commit_user_email: "${{ env.GIT_COMMIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL }}"
    commit_author: "${{ env.GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR }}"
```
