Once again, I'm participate to the 2019 edition of the Hacktoberfest.

This month, I will focus on my open-source projects

- [byteslice](https://github.com/rlespinasse/byteslice), a go library to manipulate a byte array,
- [hoff](https://github.com/rlespinasse/hoff), a go library to run workflows with high order functions - **a new name is required :)** ,
- and the new one [bitframe](https://github.com/rlespinasse/bitframe), a go library to manipulate bit frames using data protocol with encoder and decoder capabilities.

But I don't forget to also work on `my shell` project : [michel](https://github.com/rlespinasse/michel).

If you want to contribute, some issues are availables to do so.

For the 3rd time, my company [SFEIR](https://sfeir.com/) will host events across ours agencies on 8th October with our [Open-Source Program Office](https://github.com/sfeir-open-source).
I will be at the Lille Agency ([register to our meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/SFEIR-Lille/events/265175960/)), see you there.

Happy **Hacktober** month.
