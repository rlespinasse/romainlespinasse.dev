## as Creator

1. Project ideas come from everywhere, don't limit yourself and create a public repository even when you may be the only user.

1. Don't be perfect from the start, you can improve your project during its lifetime.

1. You can choose any name for your project, sometimes a descriptive name, sometimes a play of words.

## as Maintainer

1. Learn to say **no** as Maintainer or to choose your own way to deal with a situation.

1. Don't support all releases of your project all the time, you can depreciate version series.

1. Don't be afraid to `archived` a project if you unmaintained it.

1. Don't put yourself under pressure to respond quickly as possible to issues or pull-requests submissions.
