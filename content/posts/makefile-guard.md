When you use a variable in a Makefile task and you want to make it mandatory and check it before run the effective task,

You can `guard` it

```Makefile
task-who-need-SPECIFIC_ENVVAR: guard-SPECIFIC_ENVVAR
	@echo ${SPECIFIC_ENVVAR}
```

You only need to add the following task

```Makefile
guard-%:
	@ if [ "${${*}}" = "" ]; then \
		echo "Environment variable $* not set"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
```

So when you run it, the `guard` will prevent to run the task

```shell
$ make task-who-need-SPECIFIC_ENVVAR
Environment variable SPECIFIC_ENVVAR not set
make: *** [guard-SPECIFIC_ENVVAR] Error 1
```

```shell
$ export SPECIFIC_ENVVAR=value
$ make task-who-need-SPECIFIC_ENVVAR
value
```
