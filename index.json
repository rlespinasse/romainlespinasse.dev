The choice to use a wiki is quite common in the corporate world.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about you, developer on one of these programs, is documentation of your different projects managed by an easily accessible and editable wiki?\nIf you look at the content of this wiki, you will probably find:\nPages with sections who still need documentation, Pages with incorrect information, Deprecated pages, Pages only useful for one team or another, Pages with documentation on a feature still in development. So you wonder how to make it easier for people working on different projects.\nAt this point, the principle of documentation as code seems to be the solution to your needs.\nYou embark on the adventure of documentation as code Seeing the documentation as code as the sources of the program is interesting. You want to replace your current wiki with a project dedicated to documentation, and allowing you to make code review on these changes. But that only corrects part of the problem, you only replaced wiki pages with files written in another format like:\nthe Markdown format, the Asciidoc format. Due to its simple and accessible syntax, Markdown is one of the most popular formats, especially on sites like github or gitlab, but it is too simple for further documentation.\nAsciidoc is more interesting , allowing to be more expressive with your documentation. The associated tool Asciidoctor provides useful features as well as integrations such as diagram generation with plantuml .\nYou therefore choose to write the Asciidoctor documentation in each of your projects. This allows you to deliver the documentation at the same time as the associated code.\nEven if your program consists of a set of projects, each with its own documentation, you want to keep a single site to access them.\nThe people behind Asciidoctor have recently released an aggregated documentation site generator: Antora in a stable version (1.0.0) to the open-source community.\nYou create your new documentation site with Antora / Asciidoctor A site generated by Antora is composed of three elements :\nYour projects that contain their documentation, The playbook that configures the generation of the documentation site, A UI that defines the visuals of your site (the default one will be appropriate). To be used by Antora, a project must respect a file structure ./docs ├── antora.yml └── modules └── ROOT ├── _attributes.adoc ├── nav.adoc └── pages ├── _attributes.adoc └── index.adoc You set up documentation as code on your projects So you apply yourself to put it up on:\nYour APIs (api A , api B , [api C](https : //github.com/rlespinasse/api-c)) Your tools (build tools ), Your development guide (guidelines ). The documentation in Asciidoctor format is available in the docs folder.\nIt is not necessary to use this tree for guideline, which is only a documentation project.\nYou are preparing to generate your documentation site So you create a specific project to store the playbook.\nsite: title: \u0026#34;Romain Lespinasse // Docs\u0026#34; start_page: guidelines::index url: https://rlespinasse.github.io/docssite content: sources: - url: https://github.com/rlespinasse/api-a.git branches: master tags: v* start_path: docs - url: https://github.com/rlespinasse/api-b.git branches: master tags: v* start_path: docs - url: https://github.com/rlespinasse/api-c.git branches: master tags: v* start_path: docs - url: https://github.com/rlespinasse/buildtools.git branches: master tags: v* start_path: docs - url: https://github.com/rlespinasse/guidelines.git branches: master ui: bundle: url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable snapshot: true output_dir: ui-bundle supplemental_files: ./supplemental-ui output: dir: ./docs The content of the playbook site.yml defines:\nthe related information to the site itself via site:, the definition of content via content:, the theme of the site via ui:, The build folder via output:. The official documentation does not refer to it because it is a development still experimental but you set up the navigation bar to add the useful links via a header-content.hbs file in supplemental-ui/partials/.\nOther template files are available for replacement in Antora Default UI .\nYou generate and deploy your new documentation site You can install antora via this guide or use the docker image via the docker run -v `pwd` command: / antora --rm antora / antora --stacktrace site.yml (where site.yml is the playbook)\nThe playbook defines the docs folder to make your new documentation site available.\nFor example, to make it accessible on Github, you deploy it via the Github Pages of your docssite project.\nThe platform will automatically expose the contents of the /docs folder to https://rlespinasse.github.io/docssite .\nYou make others benefit from the new documentation site From now on, people working on the program will be able to add, create, and maintain documentation of each project very easily. Your new documentation site gives the access to all these pages.\nThe site docs.antora.org uses the Antora project itself.\nThanks to Aurélien Allienne , Antoine Méausoone , Tanguy Baudrin , and Tony Proum for reviewing the article.

Mais sous macOS, pas de apt-get, pas de yum, vous voilà parti pour installer tout cela à la main.\nPas de crainte, des gestionnaires de formulas existent aussi pour macOS comme Homebrew (ou MacPorts )\nInstaller homebrew en une ligne de commande\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\u0026#34; Homebrew est un gestionnaire basé sur des formulas d\u0026rsquo;installation de formula (en Ruby) et utilise des repositories git comme conteneurs de ces formulas.\nAprès une simple installation, vous avez à votre disposition une nouvelle commande, petit tour du proprietaire :\nLa commande \u0026ldquo;brew\u0026rdquo; vous montre les commandes les plus courantes.\n$ brew Example usage: brew search [TEXT|/REGEX/] brew (info|home|options) [FORMULA...] brew install FORMULA... brew update brew upgrade [FORMULA...] brew uninstall FORMULA... brew list [FORMULA...] Troubleshooting: brew config brew doctor brew install -vd FORMULA Dans ces commandes, on retourne notamment celles pour gérer le cycle de vie de votre formula\nbrew install FORMULA\u0026hellip; brew update brew upgrade [FORMULA\u0026hellip;] brew uninstall FORMULA\u0026hellip;\nTIP: En executant brew doctor, vous vérifiez que votre installation de Homebrew est correcte. La commande vous indiquera les différents problèmes de votre installation (s\u0026rsquo;il y en a).\nMaintenant que homebrew est installé, vous souhaitez installer vos premiers formulas.\nVous commencez par vos besoins pour le projet. Comme il s\u0026rsquo;agit d\u0026rsquo;un projet en Java sous Gradle avec des outils écrits en Go et que l\u0026rsquo;ensemble est géré par Ansible, vous avez votre liste de formulas:\nAnsible Java Go Gradle Vous installez vos formulas hors java\n$ brew install ansible go gradle $ ansible --version ansible 2.2.0.0 $ go version go version go1.7.4 darwin/amd64 $ gradle -v Gradle 3.3 Vous installer java à part, car vous souhaitez installer java 8.\nVous rechercher donc les formulas nommées java\n$ brew search java app-engine-java google-java-format javarepl jslint4java libreadline-java homebrew/emacs/javaimp Caskroom/cask/eclipse-java Caskroom/cask/java Caskroom/cask/netbeans-java-ee Caskroom/cask/netbeans-java-se Caskroom/cask/yourkit-java-profiler Caskroom/versions/charles-applejava Caskroom/versions/charles-beta-applejava Caskroom/versions/java-beta Caskroom/versions/java6 Caskroom/versions/java7 Caskroom/versions/java9-beta Aie, il n\u0026rsquo;y a pas de formula nommée java ou java8. Par contre la recherche vous propose les formulas contenant le mot java. Parmis les formulas, ceux avec un chemin (a/b/formula) sont des formulas contenues dans des taps.\nMais qu\u0026rsquo;est-ce qu\u0026rsquo;un tap, il s\u0026rsquo;agit d\u0026rsquo;un autre repository git contenant des formulas dédiées ou des nouvelles commandes.\nOn installe un tap via la commande brew tap utilisateur/nom_tap.\nAvec le tap utilisateur/nom_tap, brew installera le repository git associé à l\u0026rsquo;url https://github.com/utilisateur/homebrew-nom_tap .\nPour les autres possibilités, utilisez brew tap -h.\nTIP: brew install a/b/formula installera le tap et la formula en même temps.\nParmis les taps officiels, on peut trouver :\nhomebrew/core - Core formulae for the Homebrew formula manager (the default tap) homebrew/science - Scientific formulae for the Homebrew formula manager homebrew/games - Games formulae for the Homebrew formula manager homebrew/completions - Shell completion formulae for the Homebrew formula manager homebrew/command-not-found - Ubuntu’s command-not-found equivalent for Homebrew on OSX homebrew/services - Starts Homebrew formulae\u0026rsquo;s plists with launchctl Tous ces taps sont gérés par la communauté Homebrew, mais certains taps officiels ne sont pas de Homebrew mais sont bien intégrés comme Caskroom/cask.\nLes formulas de Caskroom/cask sont dédiés aux installations d\u0026rsquo;applications macOS\nMaintenant, vous installez java 8\n$ brew install Caskroom/cask/java ==\u0026gt; brew cask install Caskroom/cask/java ... $ java -version java version \u0026#34;1.8.0_112\u0026#34; Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-b16) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.112-b16, mixed mode) Lors du lancement de la commande, brew a transféré votre demande à brew cask install pour son installation.\nAvec Cask, vous pouvez, en plus de vos formulas, installer votre navigateur, votre éditeur de code,\u0026hellip;\nbrew cask install google-chrome intellij-idea docker slack TIP: brew tap caskroom/drivers vous permet d\u0026rsquo;installer les drivers pour macOS. Les fonts s\u0026rsquo;installent elles via brew tap caskroom/fonts.\nCertains formulas sont gérées comme des services via macOS launchd. Pour cela, brew propose, via homebrew/services , la commande brew services pour faciliter leurs utilisations.\nPour votre projet, vous avez aussi besoin d\u0026rsquo;une base de données MySQL.\nVous installez MySQL qui possède un service sous macOS\n$ brew install mysql $ brew services list Name Status User Plist mysql stopped $ brew services start mysql ==\u0026gt; Successfully started `mysql` (label: homebrew.mxcl.mysql) $ brew services list Name Status User Plist mysql started \u0026lt;your_username\u0026gt; ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist Votre installation de poste est terminée. Vous pouvez commencer à travailler.\nAu bout d\u0026rsquo;un certain temps, vous souhaiteriez mettre à jour vos formulas.\nLa procédure de mise à jour se fait en deux commandes update + upgrade. Avec ces 2 commandes, vous pouvez aussi utiliser deux autres commandes outdated et cleanup utiles suivant vos besoins.\nupdate met à jour les repositories git des taps, $ brew update Updated 2 taps (caskroom/cask, homebrew/core). ==\u0026gt; New Formulae ==\u0026gt; Updated Formulae go ✔ upgrade met à jour les formulas, $ brew upgrade ==\u0026gt; Upgrading 1 outdated formula, with result: go 1.7.4_1 ==\u0026gt; Upgrading go ==\u0026gt; Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/go-1.7.4_1.sierra.bottle.tar.gz ... 🍺 /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.7.4_1: 6,438 files, 250.7M outdated liste les formulas qui doivent être mis à jour, $ brew outdated go (1.6) \u0026lt; 1.7.4_1 cleanup supprime les anciennes versions des formulas (car Homebrew les garde indéfiniment). $ brew cleanup Removing: /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6... (6,438 files, 250.7M) ==\u0026gt; This operation has freed approximately 250.7M of disk space. Définissez un alias bubu (déjà disponible par défaut dans zsh) pour brew update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; brew outdated \u0026amp;\u0026amp; brew upgrade \u0026amp;\u0026amp; brew cleanup, et ainsi en une commande gèrer vos formulas plus simplement.\nVous venez d\u0026rsquo;apprendre qu\u0026rsquo;un des mécanismes par défaut de Homebrew est de conserver toutes les versions installées de vos formulas. Ceci dans le but de vous permettre de facilement switcher entre ces versions.\nbrew install \u0026lt;formula\u0026gt; ne permet d\u0026rsquo;installer que la version courante du formula, jamais une ancienne version.\nPar exemple comment passer à une version go 1.6 puis revenir sur une version go 1.7\n$ brew switch go 1.6 Cleaning /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6 Cleaning /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.7.4_1 3 links created for /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6 $ brew switch go 1.7.4_1 Cleaning /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6 Cleaning /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.7.4_1 3 links created for /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.7.4_1 TIP: Le tap homebrew/versions vous permet d\u0026rsquo;accèder à d\u0026rsquo;anciennes versions.\nSur le projet, votre voisin de bureau commence sa première journée et vous demande de lui passer votre liste de formulas et d\u0026rsquo;applications pour faire lui aussi l\u0026rsquo;installation rapidement.\nVous appliquez la méthode KISS\nbrew list \u0026gt; brew-formulas.txt brew cask list \u0026gt; brew-applications.txt Et votre voisin devrait se débrouiller avec les deux fichers bruts que vous venez de lui envoyer par email. C\u0026rsquo;est KISS mais seulement pour vous.\nMais là encore, Homebrew a pensé à faciliter ce genre d\u0026rsquo;actions via brew bundle.\nVous créez un Brewfile de votre poste via brew bundle dump\n$ brew bundle dump $ cat Brewfile tap \u0026#39;caskroom/cask\u0026#39; tap \u0026#39;homebrew/bundle\u0026#39; tap \u0026#39;homebrew/core\u0026#39; tap \u0026#39;homebrew/services\u0026#39; brew \u0026#39;ansible\u0026#39; brew \u0026#39;go\u0026#39; brew \u0026#39;mysql\u0026#39;, restart_service: true brew \u0026#39;gradle\u0026#39; cask \u0026#39;docker\u0026#39; cask \u0026#39;google-chrome\u0026#39; cask \u0026#39;intellij-idea\u0026#39; cask \u0026#39;java\u0026#39; cask \u0026#39;slack\u0026#39; Un fichier Brewfile commence par lister les taps installés, puis les formulas installés, ainsi que les applications. Il garde même en mémoire les status des services (ici, mysql est lancé).\nVous transmettez le fichier Brewfile à votre voisin et il n\u0026rsquo;a plus qu\u0026rsquo;à l\u0026rsquo;utiliser.\nVotre voisin de bureau installe ce Brewfile sur son poste\n$ brew bundle Tapping caskroom/cask Tapping homebrew/bundle Using homebrew/core Tapping homebrew/services Installing ansible Installing go Installing gradle Installing mysql Installing docker Installing google-chrome Installing intellij-idea Installing java Installing slack TIP: Par défaut, brew bundle utilise le fichier Brewfile depuis le dossier courant. L\u0026rsquo;option --file=path permet de définir un autre chemin vers le fichier Brewfile. L\u0026rsquo;option --global ira lire un fichier .Brefile depuis votre $HOME.\nAprès la découverte de brew bundle, vous vous dites autant partager la liste des formulas nécessaire pour un projet spécifiquement.\nPour cela, il suffit de créer un fichier Brewfile dans vos sources de projet et de le commiter. Comme cela un nouveau développeur n\u0026rsquo;a qu\u0026rsquo;à lancer brew bundle pour être sûr d\u0026rsquo;avoir le nécessaire pour travailler sur le projet.\nCela tombe bien, vous avez un nouveau projet en Java sous Gradle à faire et qui servira comme outil aux autres développeurs.\nVous créez un Brewfile dans votre nouveau projet avec Java et Gradle\n$ cd project-tool $ vim Brewfile $ cat Brewfile tap \u0026#39;caskroom/cask\u0026#39; brew \u0026#39;gradle\u0026#39; cask \u0026#39;java\u0026#39; Après que ce nouveau projet soit prêt, il est temps que les autres développeurs l\u0026rsquo;utilisent. Pour faciliter sa distribution, vous l\u0026rsquo;avez publié dans votre repository manager de votre client (ex. Nexus).\nUn de vos collègues teste l\u0026rsquo;installation du nouvel outil\n$ tool_url=\u0026#39;https://nexus.client.tld/content/repositories/releases/tld/client/project/tool/1.0.0/tool-1.0.0-distribution.zip\u0026#39; $ wget $tool_url $ unzip tool-1.0.0-distribution.zip $ tree tool-1.0.0-distribution ├── bin │ └── tool └── lib └── tool-1.0.0.jar $ chmod u+x tool-1.0.0-distribution/bin/tool $ echo \u0026#34;export PATH=\\\u0026#34;$(pwd)/tool-1.0.0-distribution/bin:\\$PATH\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc $ . ~/.bashrc $ tool --version 1.0.0 Mais la procédure d\u0026rsquo;installation n\u0026rsquo;est pas aussi simple que d\u0026rsquo;écrire brew install project-tool. Pourquoi ne pas créer une formula aussi pour ce projet?\nAvant de la créer, vous vous demandez comment la sauvegarder? Homebrew vous propose déjà des taps pour avoir plus de formulas disponibles.\nVous pouvez créer un tap privé qui est un simple repository git. Par défaut, un tap ajouté via brew tap utilisateur/nom_tap corresponds à l\u0026rsquo;url https://github.com/utilisateur/homebrew-nom_tap.git Si vous voulez le stocker ailleurs, l\u0026rsquo;ajout se fait par brew tap utilisateur/nom_tap git@git.client.tld:utilisateur/homebrew-nom_tap.git.\nNOTE: Dans un Brewfile, ajouter la ligne tap 'utilisateur/nom_tap', 'git@git.client.tld:utilisateur/homebrew-nom_tap.git' pour déclarer ce tap.\nUne fois que vous avez créé et ajouté ce tap privé, vous pouvez passer à la création de la formula via la commande create.\n$ brew create $tool_url --set-name project-tool --set-version 1.0.0 --tap utilisateur/nom_tap ==\u0026gt; Downloading https://nexus.client.tld/content/repositories/releases/tld/client/project/tool/1.0.0/tool-1.0.0-distribution.zip ######################################################################## 100,0% Please `brew audit --new-formula project-tool` before submitting, thanks.

Homebrew téléchargera et décompressera le zip du projet automatiquement (via url et sha256) réalisant les étapes 1 et 2.\nPour l\u0026rsquo;étape 3, la fonction install s\u0026rsquo;éxecute dans le dossier décompressé. Par contre, ce dossier est temporaire, vous devez demander à garder les dossiers bin et lib dans libexec.\nUne formula propose plusieurs répertoires pour stocker des fichiers utiles. Le dossier libexec sert à stocker des fichiers uniquement nécessaire à la formula. Via libexec.install, vous pouvez demander qu\u0026rsquo;un dossier y soit stocké.\nAfin de réaliser l\u0026rsquo;étape 4, vous devez demander à lier le script libexec/bin/tool au PATH via bin.install_symlink. Cette action réalise également l\u0026rsquo;étape 5 car bin.install_symlink gére aussi les permissions.\nLe test de l\u0026rsquo;étape 6 se fera par brew test, ceci une fois la fonction test remplie dans la formula. Ce test peut simplement être que l\u0026rsquo;éxecution de tool --version fonctionne.\nDe plus, une formula peut définir des pré-requis comme par exemple que Java 8 (ou plus) soit installé.
